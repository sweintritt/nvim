# neovim config

My neovim configuration. I started with the intro from the
[Primeagan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE). I switched then to
and switched to the [LazyVim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE), which
was way to much and then used
[Kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) as a starting point
and added to it.
Kickstart is realy nice because it gives you a good starting point, but not to much.
