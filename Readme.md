neovim config
==============

My neovim configuration, using
[LazyVim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE).
I started with the intro from the [Primeagan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE)
and switched to the LazyVim configuration.

I really tried using neovim as an IDE but switched back to IntelliJ. Sorry.
I use vim as an powerfull editor and for small coding projects but for the
larger projects I use IntelliJ or PyCharm.
